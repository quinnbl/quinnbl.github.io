# My Thoughts on Code Standards

  I believe coding standards are important, to a point. When someone ignores coding standards and does anything they feel like, using semicolons for indentation for one, or writing enormous one line pieces of code, it makes it hard for anyone to work with them. It could even make it hard for them to work with themselves! If they do not comment on their code, or use a consistent case system for their code it can become a bit of a mess. 
  
  But these are extreme cases. If someone does not fix their 'trailing spaces' or 'padded blocks' or even "double quotes for strings" issues I do not see how this would affect their overall efficacy as a coder or their ability to work in a team. Personally I think padded blocks look nice because they allow each line or group of lines to be on its own. Trailing spaces is what IntelliJ seems to do on its own and I could not tell it was there is ESLint did not tell me it was. Maybe there is some hidden technical detail I do not know of, but I also do not see any reason for caring about which quotes are placed around strings. So for some of these pedantic issues I think coding standards can go too far, and I think I would find it more difficult than helpful to work in a place that took this concept too far. However, working on a team with someon who followed no standards, who made a jumble of code that followed no rhyme or reason would likely be worse, so I will not complain about coding standards too much.
