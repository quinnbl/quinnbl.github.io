When I got out of high school I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. Because of this, I delayed college and worked as a waiter for a year. After a year in the service industry, I knew that wasn’t what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. So I went to community college, planning on going to medical school and following in my mother’s footsteps. After doing some research and talking to my mothers colleagues, I realized that being a doctor wasn’t what would make me happiest in life.
That’s when I realized I had always had a passion for technology, and that nothing else had ever gotten me as excited as electronics. However, I still couldn’t make up my mind between being a hardware engineer or a software engineer. Ultimately, I decided to hedge my bets and go to school to get a degree in Computer Engineering, meeting somewhere in the middle of the two sides of my passion.
Since being immersed in the world of computers, I have learned a lot. I have decided a career that leans more towards the software side is more appealing to me. However, there are still so many realms within the software world that it is not an easy decision. I enjoy math and the deeper algorithmic side of programming, so currently my sights are set on working with artificial intelligence, data science, cybersecurity or the intersection of the three. I hope to develop the skills needed to be a proficient learner and the foundations of software engineering so that at any point in my career I can be involved in any work that suits my interests.
