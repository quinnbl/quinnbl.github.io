# A Good Question

Follow this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30501327/does-the-g-stringstream-constructor-have-a-critical-section) to see the good question.

The user had a clear and concise question about an open source project he had been looking at. The person asking the question had seen a stringstream object being created inside a for loop, and then saw an example of one being created outside the loop and calling the clear function inside the loop instead of creating a new one each time. The user wondered why this factor caused a significant performance increase and made it clear that he had done research on the topic already, and needed help to understand the mechanism behind this phenomenon.

# A Bad Question

Follow this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69124205/css-background-shorthand) to see the bad question.

This user simply asked a one sentence question about a topic without any pleasantries and without any apparent attempt to find the answer on his own. The answer was quickly given with a simple link in the comments, evidencing the fact that the user could have simply searched for the documentation himself.

# My Thoughts

Smart questions are important for all engineers, because there is a lot of complex information surrounding everything we do, and we will never truly grasp all of it. It is also very difficult for us to search through lengthy and dry documentation each time we have a question, especially so when there is often an easier way, namely, relying on those with more experience in a subsection of engineering than oneself. 

If we are able to develop a more effective method of asking questions, we will then be able to strengthen this tool that we have and become more effective and experienced engineers ourselves. It is by the mechanism of asking questions that we learn everything there is to know in our world, and peers are one of the most robust and responsive resources for this endeavor.
