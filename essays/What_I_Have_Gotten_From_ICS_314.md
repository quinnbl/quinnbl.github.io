  I have learned quite a few useful skills and methods in ICS 314. Beyond basic web development skills, which I can see coming in handy, I have learned a lot about team based software development in general.
  
## IDE
  I have seen firsthand how, in large projects especially, the development environment can make a huge difference. The ability to quickly search through a well made IDE is a huge plus I have found with most environments. To be able to run multiple different programs from within that environment has also been a great hand in making projects that span many different areas. Most importantly, keeping everything organized and together is something that an IDE helps with tremendously.

## Functional Programming
  Functional programming was something very new to me, that frankly did not make much sense at first. Why would I pass a function instead of just passing data? However, in certain cases of working with large amounts of data in specific forms, functional programming is a godsend. When you can quickly and easily pass over a large swathe of data and make it conform to your needs, why would you not utilize functional programming?

## Issue Driven Project Management
  Issue driven project management is a form of project management wherein you make small issues that altogether lead to a finished project, and split them up amongst a team. In GitHub, you can base your branch names on the issue you are working on and easily find each branch in question. You can also manage a synced project board for your team, enabling everyone to know what is being worked on and what needs to be taken on. This strikes me as a good strategy for team development in general, not only in software. In fact, I have already successfully implemented this strategy in multiple other software projects this semester with good results. 

## Conclusion
  Overall, this semester has been a great learning experience. I have not only learned how to build websites effectively and fairly easily, I have learned a great deal about how to work in a team to build software, which will help me in whichever field I go into.
