**JavaScript Misconceptions**

So far, I am still stuck with my original thoughts on JavaScript; these largely having been formed by online forums, comment threads
and memes where it has been mentioned. It seems comparable to other scripting or object oriented languages I've used, such as C++ or Python. It is starting at a disadvantage in my mind however, as I don't particularly like Java and some of the styles used in JavaScript I have seen online have turned me off.
However, it is not as terrible as I somewhat expected and with time it seems like it might grow on me. I don't believe I am going to be a web developer anytime soon, so I am not sure if it will be the language for me, but it seems like a decent language so far. Only time and experience will tell.

As far as the WODs go, I think the approach is a good one. I always appreciate a class with more small work to build up to big projects, whether it is a math, engineering or coding class. Again, only time will tell how useful they end up being, but I have high hopes as it seems like a good strategy.
