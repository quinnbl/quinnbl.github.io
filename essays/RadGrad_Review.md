# A Senior Computer Engineering Student's View of RadGrad

RadGrad seems like a pretty cool tool to use, although I think it would have been more useful to me earlier in my college career. I am not sure that using it now has taught me anything, but there are definitely lots of opportunities there that I would not have known about when I was a freshman. By now, my plans for this semester and the next are fairly locked down and then I graduate in the spring, so it is less helpful to know about other opportunities. 


However, I am interested in the reviews of various classes functionality. I still have time to make changes to which electives I will take in the spring and this could help me with my decisions there. Beyond that, I could conceivably make time for some of the meetups listed there which would be of interest to me. 


So all in all I am not sure that the site will greatly affect my degree experience, but I do think it is a great tool for the general use case and I am glad I have the chance to be a part of it and help refine it. I hope this carries over to the computer engineering students as well soon. I also hope that in the case this does become available to computer engineering students it will mean a greater integration between computer engineering and computer science so the computer engineering program can have a greater focus on computing technology in general.
