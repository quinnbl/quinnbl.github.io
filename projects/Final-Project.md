Wave Cache is a site where people can find information on surfing breaks, find friends to surf with and more. We built this using Meteor React with Semantic UI React, JavaScript being the main language. We used Intellij for development and GitHub for version control and merging code.

I specifically developed the Landing page, as well as the .io homepage for our site. I also worked with teh database, enabling our site to track who likes a break. This required updating the array property "FollowerIDs" for the break who's page the user is on whenever they click on the "Like This Break" button. Beyond this, I helped my team with various issues they had with their own tasks.
