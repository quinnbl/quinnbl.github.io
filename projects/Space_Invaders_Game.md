I wrote this game by following a Pygame tutorial by Tech With Tim on youtube. This was a very helpful resource that reinforced my Python knowledge as well as taught me a lot about Pygame. This helped to prepare me for my machine learning project which uses artificial intelligence to create a strategy in a game made with Pygame. I also created this game as a way to teach Python as well as general coding concepts to high school students at James B. Castle High School, by leading them through the code and showing them how I took existing code from someone else and through my own understanding of programming was able to modify it to be closer to what I wanted. This was done through a program known as EngineeringHI Mentors (eHI in short), which was created by the University of Hawai'i at Manoa's College of Engineering, the UH Engineering Student Ambassadors and Castle High faculty.

My version has some added elements, such as an enhanced main menu, a credit screen, a help screen, a new losing screen and side to side movement from enemies. This took me about the length of the video plus some added time spent on my extra features, so in total approximately three hours spaced out at different intervals.
