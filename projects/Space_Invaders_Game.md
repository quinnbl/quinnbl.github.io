I wrote this game by following a Pygame tutorial by Tech With Tim on youtube. This was a very helpful resource that reinforced my Python knowledge as well as taught me a lot about Pygame. This helped to prepare me for my machine learning project which uses artificial intelligence to create a strategy in a game made with Pygame.

My version has some added elements, such as an enhanced main menu, a credit screen, a help screen, a new losing screen and side to side movement from enemies. This took me about the length of the video plus some added time spent on my extra features, so in total approximately three hours spaced out at different intervals.
